### Inspiration

My name is Stanley and I started coding when I was playing MMOPRG (Massive multiplayer online role-playing game) because I dreamed of owning my own gaming website.

I was looking for developers to help me build a platform. Most of them were unwilling to help or wanted a ton of money.

I was struggling to be a full-stack developer learning slowly day-by-day. I was trolling the web for any great resources to learn how to code. I ended up spending a ton of money to buy programming books from Amazon. 

Finally, I was given a paid opportunity to code. This gave me a ton of confidence to move forward with my life. When I started my corporate career, I was also able to begin leading major web projects. Then my life was changed when I was given as opportunity to teach web technologies at a startup in Santa Monica. I fell in love with helping people change their lives.

Whether you are an experienced developer or you are just starting out, [this course](https://www.stanleycyang.com/) will help you **expand your skillset and increase your payscale!**
